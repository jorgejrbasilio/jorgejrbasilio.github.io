		    <p align="justify"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the quarantine was implemented, I learned a lot of things, especially about art. I tried different art styles and identified my own art style. Moreover, I enjoyed doing graphite and charcoal portraits; it was quite easy for me to do the facial features, specifically the eyes. I discovered many techniques by watching tutorials on YouTube. As a result, I did art commissions where I could get a small income to provide for my art needs. At first, I was afraid to enter the world of art since there were people who wanted to stop me from reaching my goal in art; they kept telling me that art was just a waste of money and time. Eventually, I realized that art is not just about earning money but also about learning and growing your skills. Nonetheless, I live on a quote that says, "small progress is still progress." </p>

		    <p align="justify"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I started studying digital art when I got inspired by various digital artists on social media. Learning digital art has a positive and negative impact on my lifestyle. For instance, it was one of the reasons why I got exposed to gadgets; I experienced physical and emotional changes, and maybe puberty also had a big part in it. Studying digital art is not easy; you must be patient and creative to create a masterpiece. Honestly, I wanted to master watercolor or acrylic medium; but those mediums are expensive, and I have no money to fulfill it. Therefore, I decided to do digital art since it has different mediums and features that could help to improve my skills. Eventually, I opened commissions with my friends to at least earn some money for our needs. My pandemic journey was not that stressful because I have friends that support me with my art journey.</p>

			<p align="justify"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since I was a kid, my relatives and friends have noticed that I'm good at art. I often got a lot of positive feedback on my drawings. Furthermore, I joined some art events at our school and community; it helped me improve my art skills and explore more art. Doing art makes me happy, and it also became my way of relieving stress during tough times, especially during the pandemic. For me, art is an escape; it takes me to an imaginary world with positivity and happiness.</p>

			<img src="strg.jpg" width="1518.5px" height="840px">
			<p align="justify"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As an IT student, I have several strengths in terms of the IT field. First, knowledge in computer hardware and software; I took Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in senior high school. Therefore, I have some knowledge when it comes to the computer service system. I consider this as one of my strengths since I already have an idea about computer software and hardware. Second creative thinking, exploring the area of arts helps me to be more creative and find my strength. Furthermore, I used different software applications to test my creativity in developing a website. Third, being a good learner. I joined the Joint Voucher Delivery Program (JDVP) before and could follow every lesson and fulfill each hands-on activity. JDVP focused on computer systems; it enhanced my skills and knowledge in the IT field. Lastly, I'm motivated to learn new things, especially in terms of IT field. I have the willingness to learn this topic since my future career is connected to this area. I wanted to explore the field of developing websites to apply my learnings in my future job.</p>
